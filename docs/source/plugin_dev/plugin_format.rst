Plugin Format
=============

There are 3 types of valid format of a MCDR plugin, each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the user cases

See `this repository <https://github.com/MCDReforged/MCDReforged-ExamplePlugin>`__ for examples of all plugin formats

Plugin format inheriting tree:

* Solo Plugin
* Multi file Plugin (Abstract)

    * Packed Plugin
    * Directory Plugin

.. _plugin-format-solo:

Solo Plugin
-----------

Solo Plugin consists of a single python ``.py`` source file. It's the plugin format which aims for easy to write and rapid development

Being restricted with the one-file-only file format, some features are missing in solo plugin:

1. Python requirement check is not supported
2. Directly import from other plugin is not supported. Other plugin can only use
   :meth:`~mcdreforged.plugin.server_interface.ServerInterface.get_plugin_instance` to access your plugin
3. Cannot be added to MCDR plugin catalogue

When you only want to create a simple plugin as fast as possible, creating a solo plugin is always a good choice

Multi file Plugin
-----------------

Multi file plugin is the collective name for the following two plugin format, :ref:`plugin_dev/plugin_format:Packed Plugin` and :ref:`plugin_dev/plugin_format:Directory Plugin`

The biggest difference between multi file plugin and solo plugin is that, it can consist of multiple files,
rather than being limited into 1 single ``.py`` file. Therefore, more features are supported in a multi file plugin which make it easier to create a general plugin

Packed Plugin
-------------

Packed plugin is a zip type compressed file with file extension name ``.mcdr`` or ``.pyz``. It's the recommended plugin format for distribution

A minimum packed plugin consists of the following files at its zip root

* ``mcdreforged.plugin.json``, contains the metadata of the plugin
* a valid python package with your plugin id

Here's an example file tree of a minimum packed plugin with plugin id ``my_plugin``:

::

    MyPlugin.mcdr
        my_plugin/
            __init__.py
        mcdreforged.plugin.json

Optionally, a packed plugin can have some other useful files that will be recognized by MCDR:

* ``requirements.txt``, indicating the python package requirement of your plugin. It'll be checked before plugin loading
* ``lang/``, a folder storing translation files in json (``.json``) or yaml (``.yml``) format. MCDR will automatically load and register translation files in this folder

You can include any other files or folders inside your packed plugin.
You can access them via :meth:`~mcdreforged.plugin.server_interface.PluginServerInterface.open_bundled_file` method
in :class:`~mcdreforged.plugin.server_interface.ServerInterface`

Here's an example file tree of a valid packed plugin with more possible files:

::

    MyPlugin.mcdr
        my_plugin/
            __init__.py
            my_lib.py
        my_data/
            default_config.json
            some_data.txt
        lang/
            en_us.json
            zh_cn.json
        mcdreforged.plugin.json
        requirements.txt

In addition to ``.mcdr`` file extension, the python :external:doc:`zip app <library/zipapp>` file extension ``.pyz`` is also valid for a packed plugin.

Although it's not as obvious to be a MCDR plugin as ``.mcdr``, but for those plugins who provide the functionality to run in command line outside MCDR environment,
using `.pyz` extension can explicitly show that they support command line operation


Directory Plugin
----------------

Directory plugin has exactly the same file structure as :ref:`plugin_dev/plugin_format:Packed Plugin`.
The only difference is that all files of a directory plugins are inside a directory instead of a ``.mcdr`` zip file

Directory plugin is mostly used for debug purpose inside the plugin directory of MCDR

Here's an example file tree of a directory plugin:

::

    MyPlugin/
        my_plugin/
            __init__.py
            my_lib.py
        mcdreforged.plugin.json
        requirements.txt

Directory plugin will always be treated as "modified" during ``!!MCDR reload plugin`` :ref:`command:Hot reloads` command
