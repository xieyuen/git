Info Reactor
============

Info reactors are the components to react to a parsed :class:`~mcdreforged.info_reactor.info.Info` instance.
MCDR uses reactors to trigger command parsing or dispatch plugin events

If you want to add more behaviors to MCDR, like dispatching new events and so on, rather than use a plugin, you can design you own info reactor.
Since info reactors can access to the inner :class:`~mcdreforged.mcdr_server.MCDReforgedServer` object which is the core object of MCDR, so it may have much more possible usages.
But yes, as always, use with cautions

Similar to custom :doc:`/customize/handler`, you info reactor class needs to inherit from the class :class:`~mcdreforged.info_reactor.abstract_info_reactor.AbstractInfoReactor`.
Then you need to implement the :meth:`~mcdreforged.info_reactor.abstract_info_reactor.AbstractInfoReactor.react` method to give it some functionalities

After you finish coding your reactor, you need to add you reactor class path to the :ref:`configuration:custom_info_reactors`
option of the configuration file, then your reactor will start working automatically
